            <p class="movieabout">"Goblin" tells the story of an 
                immortal goblin named Kim Shin (played by Gong Yoo)
                who is cursed with immortality 
                and has been living for hundreds of years. 
                He longs for a human bride who can end his eternal life. 
                The goblin's fate intertwines with Ji Eun-tak (played by Kim Go-eun), 
                a high school student who has the ability to see ghosts. 
                Eun-tak is the "goblin's bride" and holds the key to his mortality.
